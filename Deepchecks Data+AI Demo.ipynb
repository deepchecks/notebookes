    "2. Second, we note the the model is also doing worse for reports with low average word length. This has also been surfaced by our Property Drift check, but now after looking at the models' performance we can say something more - we have Concept Drift! The low formality samples in the test data (mostly Sports) also use simpler language (shorter words) in the test set compared to the training data, and that's an additional reason why our model is doing worse on these new sport samples in the test data."
